This is an introductory section.
Kindly leave some comments here.


--------------------------------

When branch A-01 has 1 commit ahead of master, which is now at step 32 in README while master has only 12 steps,
We add these two lines in master branch, introduction file.

Currently, master branch has some changes that branch A-01 does not have.
Before carrying out any merging, we need to pull every changes from the master branch first.

LINES ABOVE WILL BE ADDED TO README STEPS LATER.

--------------------------------

2nd attempt: Add in master branch, where branch A-01 does not have this line.
